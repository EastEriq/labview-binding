## About the [LabVIEW](http://www.ni.com/labview) binding for Tango
This is the LabVIEW client and server API for [Tango](http://tango-controls.org). 
It runs on Linux and Windows and supports both the x86 and x64 version of LabVIEW.

## Documentation
The provided 'quick start guide' explains how to implement a Tango device server in LabVIEW.
See `../doc/quick-start-guide/Writing a Tango Device Server in LabVIEW.pdf`

## Binary Distributions
The [releases page](https://github.com/tango-controls/labview-binding/releases) might contain a binary package that could fit your needs - particularly on Windows. Please, have a look to the available packages before trying to recompile the source code. 

## Compiling the binding
In its implementation, the LabVIEW binding implementation relies on a shared library written in C++ and a few hundreds of LabVIEW VIs. In order to maintain backward compatibility with the existing applications, these VIs are distributed as a ```llb```. The latter is itself generated by a dedicated LabVIEW project located in ```visrc```. In case you want - or need - to rebuild the ```llb```, all you need to do is to open  ```visrc/build_library.lvproj``` then build  ```Flattened LLB``` located under ```Build Specifications```. The resulting library should be located into ```vis/tango_vi.llb```.

## How to build the C++ library on Windows using Microsoft Visual C++ 
- software requirements 
  * Microsoft Visual C++ >= 2013 (a.k.a msvc12) 
  * LabVIEW x86 and/or x64 >= 2014
  
- clone the github repository in a directory of your choice (here we use c:\github)
```
cd c:\github 
git clone git@github.com:tango-controls/labview-binding.git
```

- download (or provide your own) Tango software chain (i.e. headers & libraries of Tango and its dependencies)
The [releases page](https://github.com/tango-controls/labview-binding/releases) might contain a binary package that could fit your needs. Download ```tango-for-windows.tar.gz``` and expand it under ```c:\github\labview-binding\runtime```.
Using your own Tango runtime requires `c:\github\labview-binding\windows\msvcxx\compil-env-setup.bat` to be adapted. See next section.

- edit the `compil-env-setup.bat` file
```
{edit} c:\github\labview-binding\windows\msvcxx\compil-env-setup.bat
```

- set BINDING_PATH to the labview-binding clone location  
```
set BINDING_PATH=c:\github\labview-binding 
```

- set LV_ROOT32 and/or LV_ROOT64 according to your local LabVIEW installation(s)
```
set LV_ROOT32=C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2015
set LV_ROOT64=C:\Program Files\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2014
```

- save the `compil-env-setup.bat` file then open the Visual C++ project
```
{double-click-on} c:\github\labview-binding\windows\msvcxx\run-me-to-compile.bat
```

- select the configuration you want to compile then build the solution
```
{select one of the following combination} [release or debug] / [win32 or x64]
{build}
```

- the compilation will hopefully succeed
```
{safely ignore} warning LNK4088: image being generated due to /FORCE option; image may not run
{check for presence of} c:\github\labview-binding\vis\tango_binding.dll
```

- you can optionally edit the provided LabVIEW launcher and modify the PATH env. variable
```
{edit} c:\github\labview-binding\launcher\windows\start-labview.bat

set PATH=c:\github\labview-binding\vis;%PATH%
set PATH=c:\github\labview-binding\runtime\windows\lib\vc12_dll;%PATH%
set PATH=c:\Program Files\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2014;%PATH%

{save then double-click on} c:\github\labview-binding\launcher\windows\start-labview.bat
```

- in case you want to use your own Tango runtime, just edit the `compil-env-setup.bat`, modify the paths then rebuild the solution

## How to build the C++ library on Linux using gcc 
The main constraint we have is to compile the binding with a gcc version producing a shared library which is binary compatible with the LabVIEW version we plan to use. It means we have to identify the proper gcc version to use before trying to compile the code. Fortunately, the NI website contains [a page providing this critical information]( http://digital.ni.com/public.nsf/allkb/4596349739E988088625761C005B197E). The following links could also be useful:
  * [gcc ABI policy and guidelines](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/abi.html)
  * [National Instruments support for Linux distributions](http://www.ni.com/product-documentation/52786/en/)
  * [Mixing binaries compiled with different gcc versions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23895081)
  * [How do you finds what version of libstdc++ library is installed on your linux machine?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10354636)

NB: the provided runtime for linux has been compiled with `gcc-4.3` for LabVIEW 2013 & 2014. 
 
Here is the compialtion process...
 
- clone the github repository in a directory of your choice (here we use $HOME/github)
```
cd $HOME/github
git clone git@github.com:tango-controls/labview-binding.git
```

- download (or provide your own) Tango software chain (i.e. headers & libraries of Tango and its dependencies)
The [releases page](https://github.com/tango-controls/labview-binding/releases) might contain a binary package that could fit your needs. Download ```tango-for-linux.tar.gz``` and expand it under ```c:\github\labview-binding\runtime```.
Using your own Tango runtime requires `$HOME/github/labview-binding/src/Makefile` to be adapted. This file is also the place where the gcc version to be used is specified.
  
- compile the binding 
```
cd $HOME/github/labview-binding/src
make
```

- the compilation will hopefully succeed
```
{check for presence of} $HOME/github/labview-binding/vis/tango_binding.so
```

- you can optionally edit the provided LabVIEW launcher and modify the LVB_PATH variable
```
{make the launcher executable} chmod 755 $HOME/github/labview-binding/launcher/linux/start-labview.sh

{edit} $HOME/github/labview-binding/launcher/linux/start-labview.sh

{set LVB_PATH} LVB_PATH=$HOME/github/labview-binding/runtime/linux/lib/x86/tango-9.2.2-gcc-4.3

{save then execute} $HOME/github/labview-binding/launcher/linux/start-labview.sh
```

## How to build the C++ library on Linux using cmake

This is the top priority task of the todo list. Stay tuned.

## How to build the VIs library
In case you want - or need - to rebuild the tango ```llb```, all you need to do is to open  ```visrc/build_library.lvproj``` then build  ```Flattened LLB``` located under ```Build Specifications```. The resulting library should be located into ```vis/tango_vi.llb```.
